# homebridge-mitsubishi-au-nz

Homebridge plugin for Mitsubishi air conditioners. Put together based on the incredible work at https://github.com/japaniot/homebridge-mitsubishi-aircon and the information gathered by https://github.com/NovaGL/diy-melview

Just using it for my personal units. Not fully tested. Use at your own risk...
